# Inheritance
## Aim:
To study and implement inheritance and it's types
### Theory
Inheritance is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows one class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class. This promotes code reusability, extendability, and hierarchical classification.

### Types of Inheritance
1. Single Inheritance:
A derived class inherits from a single base class.

2. Multiple Inheritance:
A derived class inherits from more than one base class.

3.Multilevel Inheritance:
A class is derived from another derived class, forming a multi-level hierarchy.

4.Hierarchical Inheritance:
Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.

5.Hybrid Inheritance:
A combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance.

### Key Points
1. Public Inheritance:
Public members of the base class remain public in the derived class.
Protected members remain protected.
Private members are not directly accessible but can be accessed via public/protected methods.

2. Protected Inheritance:
Public and protected members of the base class become protected in the derived class.

3. Private Inheritance:
Public and protected members of the base class become private in the derived class.

### Benefits of Inheritance
Code Reusability: Allows reuse of existing code.
Extendability: Facilitates the addition of new features with minimal changes.
Polymorphism: Supports the creation of more flexible and extensible systems by allowing derived classes to override base class methods.

## Output:
We learned to implement different types of inheritance in c++.
